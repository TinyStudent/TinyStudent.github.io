  * Build your goals as 3 step to achieve your future goal.
    Divide it to short-term goal, mid-term goal, long-term goal.
    It makes your goal more executable than just build the final goal.

    The reason for worry about your future is that you don't have any idea with what to do next. 
    There are two main keys to getting know your next steps.
    First one is experience. Because we're in student now, we have privilege of challenging and searching for future.
    So, just try and challenge for variety fields even it's not related to computer science.
    Also,do not confirm that you will go this way.

    The other one is mento. Meet and listen to their advices. They can help you find your goal.

    Sometimes, you would compare yourself with someone who fully in love with coding. But there's variety types of strength that needed in work such as leadership, communication skills. So there's no need to be a specialist. Actually, in the situation that someone meets people who are better than them, someone who only know about coding can be easily discouraged by them. But someone with leadership are generally learn from them and be happy for that in the same situation.

    Travel during the bootcamp. As you travel around, you will see the different view.
