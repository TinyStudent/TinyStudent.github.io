#### <b><i>SeongJae</i></b>
  - He said that the difference quality of code between companies isn't exist and code quality is determined by what is major product of company. In previous, i thought bigger company's code is better than smaller company. But I was totally wrong. So I'm surprised at what he said. 
  - And i impressed by his words that if when i grow to senior engineer(he said "get on track"), new technical skills are not what i have to learn and it can resolve my inconvenient.
