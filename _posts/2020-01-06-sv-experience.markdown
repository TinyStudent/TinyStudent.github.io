  - We ate
    - bulgogi bap
    - spicy pork bap
    - kimchi fried rice
    - locomoco
    - Surisangria(sangria with soju)

## Non-bicycle Team
- San Francisco Art Institute
  - The way to the building was a heavy slope, we had a hard time going up, it was like 북악관
  - We went here to watch galleries of the Art Institute
    - Diego Rivera gallery had nothing exhibited...
    - Path to the McBean gallery was blocked due to the construction issue
  
- Souvenir shop

  - There were some interesting souvenirs, but it was too expensive to buy
  
- Ferry

  - we took ferry to go to sausalito, the ferry's route was 'angel island - tiburon - sausalito', so it took about 1 hour
  - the sight on the ferry was great!
  
- Lime
  - we tried Lime for the first time!
  - we needed time to adapt, but we got used to it!
  - going up to the slope was very hard, we had to walk!
  - we met a lost korean girl, she wanted to go to golden gate bridge too
  - we parked our lime scooters at the vista point ... we might be charged $50 for illegal parking
  - but it was fun!
  
- Golden Gate Bridge

  - we walked on it, but we took a wrong side ... the side for bicycles
  - the view here was extraordinary!

## Come back home
- We bought some foods from Safeway at burlingame
- had foods & drinks at home

## Our thoughts
- Min Su
  - it was a fun experience, the ferry and the lime!
  - i'm tired ...
- Seong Jae
  - It was very very very very worthful experience(Riding lime, View of Golden Gate, Ferry ..)
  - Although it was so hard and tired, it was very beautiful landscape what i have never ever seen.
  - And, I felt so good during talking to my friends in home.
  - Oh, and we met Korean at Golden Gate Bridge. She was not good at ride a bike. It was funny time.
