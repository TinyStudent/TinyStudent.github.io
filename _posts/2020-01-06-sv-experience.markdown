## Non-bicycle Team
- San Francisco Art Institute
  - The way to the building was a heavy slope, we had a hard time going up, it was like 북악관
  - We went here to watch galleries of the Art Institute
    - Diego Rivera gallery had nothing exhibited...
    - Path to the McBean gallery was blocked due to the construction issue
  
- Souvenir shop

  - There were some interesting souvenirs, but it was too expensive to buy
  
- Ferry

  - we took ferry to go to sausalito, the ferry's route was 'angel island - tiburon - sausalito', so it took about 1 hour
  - the sight on the ferry was great!
  
- Lime
  - we tried Lime for the first time!
  - we needed time to adapt, but we got used to it!
  - going up to the slope was very hard, we had to walk!
  - we met a lost korean girl, she wanted to go to golden gate bridge too
  - we parked our lime scooters at the vista point ... we might be charged $50 for illegal parking
  - but it was fun!
  
- Golden Gate Bridge
